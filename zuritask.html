<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="./me.jpg" alt="A photo of me">
  <p>My name is Oluyede Chinenye. I am an aspirng Fullstack web developer, <br>currently learning Frontend and Fullstack Development.</p>
     <h2>Goals</h2>
  <p>My priorities are simple, like any other aspirant developer,<br> but my situation is slightly different from most others. I already have beginner level skills in Web<br> Development, but it's hard to actually put those <br>skills into action. Hence, my goal is to be a pro at Web Development and be confident in my skills.</p>

          <li>Watching Movies: I especially enjoy crime and mystery movies, the suspense is killing!</li>
          <li>Reading Novels: I also enjoy reading novels on Crime and Adventure, they pretty much suck you into the story.</li>
          <li>Sleeping: This is probably my greatest skill and hobby. I could sleep the entire day if I didn't have so much Further Maths and Python to learn. 😝😝😝😝😝</li>
          <li>Acting Dramas with my Baby Sis: She's really creative and fun to be with.</li>
